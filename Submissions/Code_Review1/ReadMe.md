**Comments:**
- The code was very clean and understandable. The Linting didn't show me any suggestion, so it follows all the PEP8 style.
- Changes made: I changed the path to run it on my own device. In the code, I just added the round function to make the values shorter and made bigger the first plot.
- The function was clear and had docstrings inside that were useful to understand the process.
- There were some descriptively variables. For example:
    - mydata
     - last_week_flow
- There were not long codes repetitions, so that is great! The code was elegantly written.
